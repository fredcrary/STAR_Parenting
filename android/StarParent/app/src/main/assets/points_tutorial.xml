        <goal>To reduce the number of hassles so you can focus on what is most important.</goal>
        <explanation>The easiest way to deal with a problem is to avoid it.&nbsp;You avoid problems by preventing them, not pretending they don't exist.</explanation>

            <how_to_text>Children act out in many ways when they feel stressed. Look for ways to simplify the child's life or provide outlets for stress.</how_to_text>
            <example>&lt;i&gt;Toddler - &lt;/i&gt;Feed Adam before he is starved. Put him down immediately when he is done.&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Preschooler&lt;/i&gt; - Make sure she gets enough exercise.&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;School-aged&lt;/i&gt; - Make sure Chad has unstructured time to "goof off."</example>

            <example>&lt;i&gt;Toddler - &lt;/i&gt;Put an old shower curtain under his highchair.&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Preschooler&lt;/i&gt; - Eat earlier so Becky won't be so hungry.&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;School-aged&lt;/i&gt; - Buy a bright red trash basket so it is easier to notice.</example>

        <goal>To increase good behavior by noticing it and acknowledging it.</goal>
        <explanation>People see what they expect to see. If you expect to see bad behavior, you will see more bad behavior than good behavior.&nbsp;To increase a desired behavior, figure out what you want the child &lt;i&gt;to do or say&lt;/i&gt; instead of what they are doing.</explanation>

            <example>&lt;i&gt;Toddler - &lt;/i&gt;Give a big hug when he says he is done.&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Preschooler&lt;/i&gt; - The first three times Becky asks with a pleasant voice, give her what she requests.&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;School-aged&lt;/i&gt; - Say, "Each time you take the trash out without reminding, I'll give you a star. When you have five stars, you may trade them for a "task excused" ticket you may use when you want to."</example>

        <name>Acknowledge Feelings</name>
        <goal>To reflect children's feelings without judging or agreeing with them.</goal>
        <explanation>Feelings are neither good nor bad. Feelings and behaviors are different from one another. Feelings are on the inside. Behavior is what you do with those feelings. You can express feelings in both healthy and unhealthy ways.&nbsp;Accept children's feelings. Show them how to express them in healthy ways.</explanation>

            <how_to_text>Reflect the feelings and describe the situation. Active listening is nonjudgmental, asks no questions, gives no advice. It leaves the problem with the child.</how_to_text>
            <example>&lt;i&gt;Toddler - &lt;/i&gt;Say, "It's boring &lt;i&gt;(feeling)&lt;/i&gt; waiting to get down while we talk &lt;i&gt;(situation)&lt;/i&gt;."&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Preschooler&lt;/i&gt; - "Sounds like you're disappointed &lt;i&gt;(feeling)&lt;/i&gt; that you can't have a cookie now &lt;i&gt;(situation)&lt;/i&gt;."&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;School-aged&lt;/i&gt; - "I wonder if it's annoying &lt;i&gt;(feeling)&lt;/i&gt; having to take the trash out right after supper &lt;i&gt;(situation)&lt;/i&gt;?"</example>

        <name>Set Reasonable Limits</name>
        <goal>To establish clear boundaries and let kids test them.</goal>
        <explanation>Children need reasonable limits or rules. Rules can be negotiable (some flexibility) or non-negotiable (no exceptions).&nbsp;Normal children test limits. Persistent children test limits many more times. Remember, persistence is an excellent adult trait. You want to guide it, not crush it.&nbsp;Before you make a rule, decide what you will do if the child tests or challenges it.</explanation>

            <example>&lt;i&gt;Toddler - &lt;/i&gt;Food is for eating.&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Preschooler&lt;/i&gt; - Two ideas: Speak pleasantly. &lt;i&gt;Or&lt;/i&gt; No food 30 minutes before meals.&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;School-aged&lt;/i&gt; - Trash taken out before 7:00.</example>

            <how_to_title>How to give consequences</how_to_title>
            <how_to_text>State rule and what will happen if it is broken. Effective consequences are related to behavior and are immediate. &lt;i&gt;Both&lt;/i&gt; choices in the consequence are acceptable to parent.</how_to_text>
            <example>&lt;i&gt;Toddler - &lt;/i&gt;"If you throw food, you are done eating." Remove food and put him down.&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Preschooler&lt;/i&gt; - "If you whine, the answer will be no."&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;School-aged&lt;/i&gt; - "Chores and privileges go together. If you forget to take the trash out before 7:00 P.M., you lose a privilege that evening." A privilege might be computer use, TV, reading in bed, etc.</example>

            <how_to_text>State your preference and your child's preference, and &lt;i&gt;ask the child&lt;/i&gt; for a way that works for both of you. (Children are more likely to accept ideas they suggest.)</how_to_text>
            <example>&lt;i&gt;Toddler - &lt;/i&gt;Not age-appropriate, use two yeses instead.&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Preschooler&lt;/i&gt; - "I want you to speak pleasantly. You want to whine. How can we both be happy?"&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;School-aged&lt;/i&gt; - "My way is you take the trash out right after supper. You want to take it out late. What is a better way?"</example>

        <explanation>Many children have "blind spots"  -  skills or information you expect a child to have but he or she does not.&nbsp;The skills may be simple, like putting on clothes. Or, they may be complex, like remembering things or controlling their anger.</explanation>

            <how_to_text>Young children are natural mimics. To model a skill or behavior, do &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what you want the child to do. Modeling is enhanced by explaining what you are doing and why you are doing it.</how_to_text>
            <example>&lt;i&gt;Toddler - &lt;/i&gt;When you are done eating, say, "All done," and push your plate away.&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Preschooler&lt;/i&gt; - Model beginning to whine, then say, "That's whining, I'll speak pleasantly."&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;School-aged&lt;/i&gt; - As you start dinner, say, "I don't feel like cooking tonight, but it is my job. The sooner I start, the sooner I'll be done."</example>

Start again pleasantly."&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;School-aged&lt;/i&gt; - "Chad, it's after 7:00 P.M. and you walked by the trash without taking it out. It's time to re-do it right."</example>
