        <detail>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Purpose&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;/i&gt;To collect information (data) you
            will need to problem-solve efficiently and well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Explanation&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/i&gt;
            Helpful information is basic facts; the child's age, temperament, and experience;
            and your long-term &lt;i&gt;values&lt;/i&gt; for the child.

            The more ideas you think of, the more likely you are to find something that works for

            idea, plan how to make it successful, and DO IT (carry out the plan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Explanation:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
            Sadly, many good ideas fail because the person did not adequately prepare or neglected
            to follow through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Effective plans usually have a &lt;i&gt;written&lt;/i&gt;
            plan that include:&lt;/b&gt;</detail>

            can be improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Explanation&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/i&gt; Few plans
            work well the first time. Many plans need 3 or 4 revisions before they are successful.
            As you gain experience, plans become more effective.
