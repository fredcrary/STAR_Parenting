    <description>[b]Two-and-a half-year-old[/b] daughter whines whenever she can&#8217;t have what she wants. It can be a puzzle she can&#8217;t quite do or my refusal to give her a cookie right before supper.[br][b]Five-year-old[/b] whines when he can&#8217;t find the toy or book he wants.[br][b]Nine-year-old[/b] whines because he is hungry and wants a snack NOW, even though dinner is twenty minutes away.</description>
    <goal>For children to use a pleasant voice when asking for something, and to accept &#8216;No&#8221; gracefully when told &#8220;No.&#8221;</goal>
    <reality_check>Whining is a very common complaint. Some parents unintentionally teach children to whine by ignoring them when they speak pleasantly. Children learn to whine because it gets through to their parents. You may want to notice what happens before the whining. Children (and adults) often whine when tired, hungry, or stressed.</reality_check>

    <title>Grocery store tantrums</title>
    <age_group>preschool</age_group>
    <description>I hate grocery shopping. If it&#8217;s not one thing, it&#8217;s another. If I put Jenny, 3&#189;, in the cart, she cries to get down. If I put her down, she runs away. The few times she stays near me, she begs for everything she sees.</description>
    <goal>To be able to go grocery shopping with Jenny and have it be a pleasant experience. Specifically, to have Jenny stay in the cart or next to me to be safe while I am shopping. Looking at [i]values,[/i] courtesy and safety are important to me.</goal>
    <reality_check>[i]Developmentally[/i] she is in the power and identity stage. Jenny wants to be her own person, and do what she wants. She often doesn&#8217;t like to do what she is told. By [i]temperament[/i] Jenny is physically active, intense, and persistent. No matter how often I say &#8220;no&#8221; she&#8217;ll ask &#8220;why&#8221; and keep trying the same thing, over and over again.</reality_check>
    <idea>
      <idea_text>Bring a small bag of toys for Jenny that she only gets to play with in the store.</idea_text>

    <idea>
      <idea_text>Say, &#8220;You&#8217;re the driver. Tell me which way to turn the cart and we&#8217;ll drive around and find the items we need!&#8221;</idea_text>
      <star_point>Change things</star_point>
    </idea>
    <idea>
      <idea_text>Go as a family and make a game. Mom gives Dad and Jenny an item to hunt for. When they bring it back she gives them another item. When done they go for lunch or a treat together.</idea_text>
      <star_point>Change things</star_point>
    </idea>
    <idea>
      <idea_text>Say, &#8220;Jenny, you can go grocery shopping with me and stay in the cart or I can have a sitter come over and you can stay here.&#8221;</idea_text>
      <star_point>Two yeses</star_point>

    <idea>
      <idea_text>Say, &#8220;You can sit in the cart and eat a nutritious snack, or you can walk beside the cart and hand me items we need.&#8221;</idea_text>
      <star_point>Two yeses</star_point>

      <idea_text>Before you go grocery shopping, take her to the park to run off energy.</idea_text>

      <idea_text>When she wiggles and whines, take deep breaths and remain calm when you respond.</idea_text>

      <idea_text>Each time she gets something and puts it in the cart, give her a thumbs-up sign and ruffle her hair.</idea_text>
      <star_point>Attention</star_point>
    </idea>
    <idea>
      <idea_text>Reinforcing positive behavior at the grocery store with a treat from home that can be eaten in the cart. Start with a whole small box of kid crackers; then a container with a couple slices of fruit. If the problem behavior starts in the store, tell her you will put the snack away and it will only come out after a few minutes of good behavior. rw &amp;</idea_text>
      <star_point>Consequences</star_point>
    </idea>
    <idea>
      <idea_text>Jenny likes stickers. You can set up a system where she gets stickers when she sits calmly in the cart and/or walks pleasantly beside the cart. After she earns four stickers, she&#8217;ll get an ice cream cone. You could do this two times and then taper off. She could earn only stickers, then just praise. And, eventually, you can drop the praise.</idea_text>

    <idea>
      <idea_text>When she helps you find something from shopping list, say, &#8220;You are a good helper. It&#8217;s easier to find all the items with your help.&#8221;</idea_text>

      <idea_text>When she does sit in the cart well, say, &#8220;You must be very proud of yourself for staying in the cart all the time!&#8221;</idea_text>

      <idea_text>Remind Jenny, &#8220;If you want to ride in the cart, you must sit still.&#8221;</idea_text>
      <star_point>Clear rules</star_point>
    </idea>
    <idea>
      <idea_text>Explain the consequences. &#8220;If you walk out of my sight in the grocery store, I will put you in the cart so I will know you are safe.&#8221;</idea_text>
      <star_point>Consequences</star_point>
    </idea>
    <idea>
      <idea_text>Say, &#8220;Jenny, you may get out of the cart if you walk by me, otherwise you will have to go back in the cart.&#8221;</idea_text>

      <idea_text>Model decision making. Say, &#8220;I really want a candy bar right now, but it&#8217;s not on my list and it isn&#8217;t good for me. So I&#8217;m not going to buy one, instead I&#8217;ll get a healthy snack that is on our list.&#8221;</idea_text>
      <star_point>Modeling</star_point>
    </idea>
    <idea>
      <idea_text>You could teach her to use a shopping list. (1) Give Jenny a copy of the shopping list with pictures. When you get something show it to her to cross off the list. (2) Tell her you can only buy things on the list. Occasionally show her something that is not on the list for her to reject. (3) Give her a couple of items from the list to find.</idea_text>
