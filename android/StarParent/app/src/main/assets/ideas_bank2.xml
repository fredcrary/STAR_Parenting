        <description>[b]Two-and-a half-year-old[/b] daughter whines whenever she can&#8217;t have what she wants. It can be a puzzle she can&#8217;t quite do or my refusal to give her a cookie right before supper.[br][b]Five-year-old[/b] whines when he can&#8217;t find the toy or book he wants.[br][b]Nine-year-old[/b] whines because he is hungry and wants a snack NOW, even though dinner is twenty minutes away.</description>
        <goal>For children to use a pleasant voice when asking for something, and to accept &#8216;No&#8221; gracefully when told &#8220;No.&#8221;</goal>
        <reality_check>Whining is a very common complaint. Some parents unintentionally teach children to whine by ignoring them when they speak pleasantly. Children learn to whine because it gets through to their parents. You may want to notice what happens before the whining. Children (and adults) often whine when tired, hungry, or stressed.</reality_check>

        <title>Grocery store tantrums</title>
        <age_group>preschool</age_group>
        <description>I hate grocery shopping. If it&#8217;s not one thing, it&#8217;s another. If I put Jenny, 3&#189;, in the cart, she cries to get down. If I put her down, she runs away. The few times she stays near me, she begs for everything she sees.</description>
        <goal>To be able to go grocery shopping with Jenny and have it be a pleasant experience. Specifically, to have Jenny stay in the cart or next to me to be safe while I am shopping. Looking at [i]values,[/i] courtesy and safety are important to me.</goal>
        <reality_check>[i]Developmentally[/i] she is in the power and identity stage. Jenny wants to be her own person, and do what she wants. She often doesn&#8217;t like to do what she is told. By [i]temperament[/i] Jenny is physically active, intense, and persistent. No matter how often I say &#8220;no&#8221; she&#8217;ll ask &#8220;why&#8221; and keep trying the same thing, over and over again.</reality_check>

        <reality_check>You are unlikely to get a quick fix. Most young children have difficulty adjusting to a new sibling. This may happen when the sibling is born or when he starts moving around. The older sibling may feel displaced or she may not have the skills she needs to get what she wants. [i]Development:[/i] Conflict may be magnified by normal developmental stages. For example, a task of children 3 to 6 is to feel powerful. The younger sibling becomes a partner in this learning.

        <title>Homework Hassles</title>
        <age_group>school-age</age_group>
        <description>Schoolwork is very emotional at our house. Grace, 8, takes 40-45 minutes to do what should be a 10 to 15 minute assignment. She daydreams, agonizes over each problem, complains about how hard they are, or begs to watch TV. She thinks the homework is too hard. I don&#8217;t believe that because she does better than average on the tests.</description>
        <goal>I want Grace to begin her assignments with an efficient, can-do attitude. To read each problem and try it before asking for help. To focus pleasantly on the assignment until she is done.</goal>
        <reality_check>Through homework kids learn how to approach difficult (or tedious) problems, and how to motivate themselves, as well as the content. Temperament and experience both influence homework. [i]Temperament:[/i] If a child is highly distractable, then she needs to learn how to focus. If a child is slow to adapt and believes it is hard, he needs to learn to update his expectation with reality. If a child is physically active he needs to learn to release that energy so he can concentrate. [i]Experience:[/i] Children who have positive experiences learning material generally continue to find learning manageable. Child for whom it was difficult often have more trouble. Also, if the family focus is on effort it will be easier for kids to learn new things than if you emphasize the product or results.</reality_check>
